Comprehensive type stubs for PyTorch with shape inference.

Shape inference is handled by meta-shape functions registered in the type checker.
This stub file only defines the basic tensor class and operations that don't use
meta-shapes (like broadcasting arithmetic and matmul).

For operations handled by meta-shapes, see pyrefly_types/src/meta_shape.rs:
- torch.reshape, torch.cat, torch.broadcast_to
- torch.squeeze, torch.unsqueeze, torch.transpose, torch.permute
- torch.sum, torch.mean, torch.prod, torch.min, torch.max, torch.all, torch.any
